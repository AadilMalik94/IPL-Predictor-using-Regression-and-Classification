# IPL Predictor using Regression and Classifcation

Welcome to my Data Science Analysis using IPL Data. As I have a passion for Cricket, this sets of analysis will look at how I take a public dataset on Kaggle and attempt to answer some interesting questions.

Background and Introduction

Since its introduction in 2003, T20 has become the star attraction within cricket for its high voltage action and exciting phases of play. As part of its popularity, the IPL (Indian Premier League), formed in 2008, began and kicked off one of the largest annual sports events in the world alongside the Football Premier League and NBA (National Basketball Association) until today. As a result of its increasing demand, teams are spending money towards a variety of avenues to gain a distinct competitive edge. One of these avenues is within data science to analyse player performance and opposition performance. As a result, the analysis of a league like this IPL is of growing importance. 

The data found from Kaggle. It uses two sets of data based from 2008 -2017; match-by-match and ball by ball statistics. The datasets are suitable to extract some key data, provide some statistical descriptive and visualizations and apply some machine learning techniques using Python. In this report, we aim to answer 2 key questions:

What is the best classification algorithm to predict the results of two teams accurately, demonstrating the most important features within it? What is the best regression algorithm to predict a bowlerâ€™s runs conceded?

I have taken my code from Kaggle and pushed it onto Github for the remaining future
